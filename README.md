Project Summary

This Power BI project examines operational inefficiencies in a telecom call centre to identify the main drivers of high operating costs. The analysis evaluated team, shift, and agent performance using metrics such as overtime hours, call duration, escalation rate, FCR, and cost per call.

🔍 Key Findings

Increased overtime and longer call durations were major contributors to higher cost per call.

Performance differences across shifts impacted efficiency and escalation rates.

More experienced agents achieved better FCR and lower escalations.

💡 Recommendations

Improve workforce planning to reduce overtime.

Optimise call handling efficiency.

Provide targeted training to improve FCR and reduce repeat calls.
